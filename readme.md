# Answerly Backend

Answerly is a **backend-first, community-driven Question & Answer (Q&A) platform**.  
This repository contains the **backend only**, built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework**, with a fully decoupled architecture designed to support any frontend (web or mobile).

The project focuses on **clean API design, authentication, permissions, and real business logic**, rather than just basic CRUD operations.

## Authentication (JWT)

Authentication is handled using **JWT (SimpleJWT)**.

### Login
`POST /api/auth/login/`


Returns:
- `access` token (short-lived)
- `refresh` token (long-lived)

### Refresh Access Token
`POST /api/auth/refresh/`


Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

All protected endpoints require:

`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`


---

## Reputation System

Reputation is automatically updated using **Django signals**.

### Rules
- Upvote on your content → **+10 reputation**
- Downvote on your content → **-2 reputation**
- Self-voting is not allowed

Reputation is stored in a **Profile model** linked one-to-one with the User.

---

## Permissions

- Anyone can **read** questions and answers
- Only authenticated users can **create** content
- Only the **author** can update or delete their question or answer
- Voting is restricted to authenticated users

---

- `refresh` (auto-set on login)

---

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
   
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run migrations

    `python manage.py migrate`


5. Start the server

    `python manage.py runserver`
